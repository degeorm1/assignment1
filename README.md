Instructions for running code 
1.Enter the input file
2.Enter the output file
3.Enter how you would like to group either by students per group or by groups, choices (A or B)
4. Enter how many amounts of groups/number of students per group (enter number amount)
5.Enter which method to sort by section or major 
6. Enter the input file again 
7. enter the output file again (
8. Asked how you would like to sort the students by groups or by students per group (enter A or B)
9. asked how many numbers of groups or how many number of students per group (enter number amount)
10. prints output
11. Enter the input file again 
12. enter the output file again (
13. Asked how you would like to sort the students by groups or by students per group (enter A or B)
14. asked how many numbers of groups or how many number of students per group (enter number amount)
15. prints output
16. File is created (Output.csv)

Known Bugs and Limitations 
1.	The code does not sort even though I implemented a sort algorithm it prints the same exact output as the main QuickGroups file 
2.	There is a constant in the files where it keeps on asking over and over about enter the input text when it should only ask it once 
3.	The code cannot read the headers if there is no space between them 
4.	The headers are very tricky, the “if” loop which nullifies the major 2 or minors, does not function correctly. The headers only read if there is a space between the names. Usually the section number would print in the major2 or minors section. 
5.	Is not able to add or edit students into the structure and into the array
