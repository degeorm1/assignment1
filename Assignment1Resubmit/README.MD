Assumptions: 
Assumptions I have made during this coding process is that I had a much better understanding going into the project of what was expected and what was needed to be delivered. I have prepared and created a plan to tackle the assignment and finish it within a reasonable time frame. I believe that I truly created a good program that satisfies a lot of the requirements. 

Instructions for running code 
1.Enter the input file
2. If input file is not csv/ correct student input file that exists in the folder it will tell it input correct file
3. Asks the user how they would like to sort the students by A, sort by the number of students, or B by the number of students per group 
4. if A asks how many numbers of groups, input a number, If B asks how many number of students
5.Asks how the user would like to sort the students, A by major or B by section? Either input A or B 
6. Enter the name of the output file you wish to create 
7. file is created in a csv output and into the terminal 
Known Bugs and Limitations 
1.	If the sorting/ grouping the students exceeds certain amount when entering the groups and overflows I had the program increment and add them to the next group up by 1,2,3â€¦so on
